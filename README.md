# XyrohLib
A cross platform app support library, interfacing to ticket systems, crash reporting, and logging frameworks.  It's a library we use internally across a raft of C# projects on multiple platforms (.net / Xamarin / Console) etc.

Not currently finished, polished, but watch this space and use and enhance as you will
